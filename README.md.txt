# To-Do List

A simple Python console application that lets you manage a temporary in-memory to-do list.  
Choose from a menu to add, remove, display tasks, or exit.

## Description

This script demonstrates:  
- A menu-driven loop for user choices (`while True`)  
- Appending and removing items in a Python list in memory  
- Conditional branching to handle user inputs (“1”, “2”, “3”, “4”)  
- Printing feedback messages to confirm actions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Because tasks are stored in a list without file persistence, all tasks will reset when you exit the program.
